# Madplanen

Proof of concept of a meal plan app based on principles learned in IT-AND1-A20 android cource.

The idea was to create a mealplanner, which could hold the content of a fridge and compare the content with needed items from a selected range. It should then be able to display which items was needed for shopping.
To incorportate more google services as per requirement for the PoC, a barcode scanner was added from google to ease the way the user adds items to the fridge (simply by scanning the barcode).
